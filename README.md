# infinite blocky runner

Here’s my entry for a recent "[Z80 Assembly Programming On The ZX Spectrum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/z80asm/)" Facebook group coding competition.

The challenge was to come up with a game in 256 bytes without using ROM routines for the ZX Spectrum. Here’s my entry, “Infinite Blocky Runner“.

Some of the other entries to the competition were strong, all source code as well as playable demos may be found at the FB group (unsure if available off-group).

At the very least, this effort fits in (exactly) 256 bytes. I know of a couple of issues (the progress bar at the top will probably wrap in odd ways, should you progress far enough). There’s no audio, no difficulty progression, but you can at least die and restart.

The code was developed using the [ASM80.com](http://www.asm80.com/) site, and is formatted using the somewhat quirky code formatter there (so I make no apologies for the layout). I was able to develop and debug entirely using the site.

Enjoy :)
